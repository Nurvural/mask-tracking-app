# mask-tracking-app
 This project is the first project developed during the Kodlama.io C# Software Developer Training Camp. It includes an application developed using the .NET framework to determine whether masks have been distributed to citizens. It follows the mask distribution process by validating identity information using the MERNÄ°S system.
